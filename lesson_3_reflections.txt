git remote

git remote add origin https://github.com/eijoac/reflections.git
origin refer to the shortname of the repository on github within this repository

git remote -v

git remote origin master

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I want to work on different computers for the same project; when a team is working on the same project.

git push origin master
git pull origin master
